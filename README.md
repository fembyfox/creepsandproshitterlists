# proshitterlists
Red Block compatible lists of accounts that follow proship accounts. uses UUIDs so you cant just scour the list to find people to harrass
You can,however use these lists with Red Block to remove these scum followers from existence. Sadly the individuals arent in these lists,but the filenames have them in there in case you want to manually handle the blocking. Adding people's follower lists that are generally creepy in nature as well

The definition of Proship/Proshipping: either seeing no issue with,or being against the harrassment of people who enjoy certain ships,which include l0li and sh0ta content, among many others.

i am not against harrassing these people but if i had a user readable list both twtter and github would send me into the ether
